\subsection{Improvements} % (fold)
\label{sub:improvements}
The slower run-time performance of IDDFS could see some improvements by storing a list of the nodes currently existing in the given path, allowing it to avoid circular paths. One particular area of interest for the performance of each informed search method would be to investigate different heuristics - in the implementation outlined here, manhattan distance was used for calculating each methods heuristic, however other methods exist that could affect how each one expands the nodes in their search tree and in what order.

\subsection{Final Thoughts} % (fold)
\label{sub:final_thoughts}
Overall, for the RNP, A* is demonstrably the most complete, optimal, and efficient general purpose search algorithm, proving to have the lowest mean run-time and lowest number of nodes expanded amongst the methods considered optimal. For memory-limited environments, however IDA* may be of use where run-time is perhaps less important. Finally, amongst the \textit{uninformed} search methods, BFS showed to be more effective over both DFS and IDDFS.
