\label{sec:introduction}
Tree and graph-based data structures are prevalent in many AI-related problems, especially in the implementation of search algorithms for finding a goal within a problem space. These algorithms are broadly divided into two categories - \Gls{uninformed} searches that contain no domain knowledge about the search space, and \Gls{informed} searches that make estimations about the relative quality of a given state. This report explores six such search methods and their \glspl{complete}, \glspl{optimal}, and efficiency as applied to the \acrlong{rnp}. The RNP is a \Gls{environment} in which a simulated robot attempts to find an optimal route to a given \textit{goal} \gls{node} in an $N \times M$ grid of nodes, where $N=width$, $M=height$ and both are non-zero. To demonstrate the execution of these search methods, a GUI-based program for building different states of the RNP, executing each algorithm, and displaying information about their results.
