Tree and graph-based search algorithms are frequently used AI-related problem domains. This report explores six such search methods and their \glspl{complete}, \glspl{optimal}, and efficiency as applied to the \acrlong{rnp}, a \Gls{environment} in which a simulated robot attempts to find an optimal route to a given \textit{goal} \gls{node} in an $N \times M$ grid of nodes, where $N=width$, $M=height$, both of which are non-zero. To demonstrate the properties of each search method, two research components were conducted - an interactive GUI visualizer showing how each method interacts with its search tree, and an analysis of their efficiency in terms of run-time and memory usage and how it relates to the use case for each method.
