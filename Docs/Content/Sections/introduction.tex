\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
Many generalized search algorithms exist that can be applied to both graph and tree-based problems. These are often broadly divided into two categories - \Gls{uninformed}, and \Gls{informed}. This report explores six such search methods - \acrfull{bfs} (uninformed), \acrfull{dfs} (uninformed), \acrfull{gbfs} (informed), \acrfull{as} (informed), \acrfull{iddfs} (uninformed), \acrfull{ida} (informed) - their \glspl{complete}, \glspl{optimal}, and efficiency. \par
Each algorithm is applied to the \acrlong{rnp} - a \Gls{environment} in which a simulated robot attempts to find an optimal route to a given \textit{goal} \gls{node} in an $N \times M$ grid of nodes, where $N=width$, $M=height$ and both are non-zero. Furthermore, a GUI-based program for building different states of the RNP, executing different search algorithms on them, and displaying information about execution time, node expanded, and path length has been developed for the purposes of demonstrating visually the content of this report.
