	I would like to acknowledge the work of Russell and Norvig \parencite{aiama}, whose book 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' was referenced significantly during both research and implementation of the search program. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Amit Patel, found at \href{http://www.redblobgames.com/}{Red Blob Games}, whose writings on A* and heuristics-based search assisted greatly in understanding these algorithms \parencite{redblob}.

\begin{frontmatter}{Software Libraries and Code Repository}
The code-base is version controlled via git and can be accessed on \href{https://github.com/jacobmilligan/robonav}{github} and uses several external libraries. These include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/philsquared/Catch}{Catch} - A header-only unit-testing framework for C++
	\item \href{https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php}{SDL2} - Platform abstraction media library used in the visualizer for opening a window, handling input and rendering graphics
	\item \href{https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/}{SDL2\_ttf} - TrueType rendering library extension for SDL2 for drawing text
	\item \href{https://github.com/jacobmilligan/Skyrocket}{Skyrocket.Path} - The platform agnostic file-system component from my game framework, Skyrocket, for navigating the file-system with ease independent of the operating system being used.
\end{itemize}
